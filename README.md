## Ideas Welcome!

If you have ideas for projects that would help Microsoft FastTrack improve our delivery, experience, or process please [submit an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/FastTrack/issues). We can't promise every idea will be implemented, but we value your feedback. Please be sure to include sufficient information that we can understand your idea and respond.

Do you have a script or tool you use that would be of value to the community? Please let us know so we can discuss potentially adding it to the catalog!


## Contributing

Please do not submit PRs to this repo - instead please contribute to the individual repos for each tool or application. Your contributions are very welcome! If you would like to make a substantial change to a project, please let us know first so we can discuss. This is to ensure we can merge your work.
